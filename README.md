# NG2-Synaptic

Currently in development

The purpose of this project is to create a Typescript implementation on the [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) project. The goal is then to adapt it into an Angular 2 Module that will allow machine learning either on the client side or server side with isomorphic angular 2 apps.

*note - This project was inspired by the desire to learn the inner workings of a neural network framework, adapting it will help me understand and maybe (problably not) improve it.* 
*For those of you wondering why I didn't just create a @types for it..*
